# <h1>Attitude-Indicator</h1>
A small project I made during my university time linking Arduino with Matlab to display IMU data on an Artificial Horizon.
It utilizes MPU-6050 6 axis IMU, DHT-11 temperature and humidity sensor and an LCD1602 Display.

Here is a wiring diagram of the setup

The IMU obtains pitch, roll and yaw data which can be used to calculate the angles and put through a Kalman filter (KalmanFilter.h library). Filtered data is serialized and then sent to Matlab.
The artificial horizon feature is available in Matlab Aerospace Toolbox so you will need it to run the project.

Project also contains a warnings.m function,which is called to display alerts in the command window when attitude indicator parameters exceed the set recommended value range.

To run theArduino code u will need 2 libraries made by Korneliusz JarzÄ™bski which can be found here:
